# Fonction for doing non-maxima suppression of overlapping boxes.
# Multiple boxes can be returned for the detection of a single face,
# so this fonction will be used to eliminate the excess of boxes found.
# It will keep only the box with best score and remove every other overlapping box.
# Input :
#   - boxes = a list of boxes corresponding to face detected by the classifier in one image
#   - scores = a list of scores associated with each box
# Output : the list of boxes to keep
# Source : Adrian Rosebrock, (Faster) Non Maximum Suppression in Python.
